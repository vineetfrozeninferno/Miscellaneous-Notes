# Statistics

## Measures
There are two major measures

* Central Tendency - where the data is centered.
* Dispersion - how the data is scattered or bunched around the Central Tendency.

## Measures of Central Tendency [Source](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/understanding-statistics/statistical-terms-and-concepts/measures-central-tendency)
### Mean
* average
* **mean = &Sigma;values / valueCount**
* [&minus;] Cannot be applied to categorical data.
* [&minus;] Affected by skewed data and outliers.

### Median [Preferred]
* Middle value when items are sorted
* **Approach**
  * sort items.
  * if odd, take the middle value.
  * if even, take the mean of two middle values.
* [&plus;] Not affected by skewed data and outliers.
* [&minus;] Cannot be applied to categorical data.

### Mode
* Most common value
* [&plus;] Can apply to categorical data.
* [&minus;] Does not represent the central tendency of data.


## Measures of Dispersion
### Range
* **Range = minValue - maxValue**
* Larger range = more dispersed data

### Deviation
* Deviation is usually calculated **from a specific measure of Central Tendency**, usually `mean` or `median`.
* **deviation = value - centralTendencyMeasure**

#### Mean Deviation
* **MeanDeviation = &Sigma;abs(deviation) / valueCount**
* Can have two forms
  * MeanDeviation from **mean**
  * MeanDeviation from **median**

#### Variance and Standard Deviation
##### Variance
* represented by **&sigma;<sup>2</sup>**
* **variance = &Sigma;(deviation)<sup>2</sup> / valueCount**

##### Standard Deviation
* represented by **&sigma;**
* **&sigma; = &radic;variance**
